Farmer Management System - Purpose Report

Date: 2025-11-11

1) System Purpose
- Provide a unified platform for coordinating smallholder farming operations, improving transparency, productivity, and payments.
- Digitize field data collection, harvest tracking, and payment workflows to reduce errors and delays.
- Give managers real-time visibility into farm activity, financial exposure, and workforce utilization.

2) Problems Addressed
- Fragmented records (paper/WhatsApp) leading to lost data and poor traceability.
- Slow farmer payments due to manual approvals and reconciliation.
- Limited insight into crop progress, yields, and field conditions.
- Difficulty planning budgets and tracking cash flow across seasons.

3) Target Users and Goals
- Field Officers
  • Quickly record field/crop visits (planting, monitoring, harvest)
  • Capture crop type, area, stage, health, expected yields, and notes
  • Submit payment/budget requests to Finance
- Farmers (as entities recorded in the system)
  • Maintain accurate profiles and fields for payment eligibility
- Finance Team
  • Review/approve requests and process payments efficiently
  • Track cash outflow and payment statuses (pending/approved/paid)
- Managers
  • Monitor active farms, workforce, and recent activities
  • Assess performance and make data-driven operational decisions

4) Core Capabilities
- Farmer & Field Management
  • Register farmers, link fields, and assign standardized codes
  • Record crop details (crop type, variety, size, stage, health, planting date, expected yield)
- Harvest Tracking
  • Log harvest quantities/grades per field, per farmer
  • Summaries for performance reporting and planning
- Payments & Finance
  • Create, approve, and mark payments as paid
  • Monitor cash flow out and budget requests
- Reporting & Oversight
  • Generate payment/performance reports for auditability
  • Manager dashboard: active farms, workers, activities, harvests

5) Data Integrity & Security Principles
- Authentication via JWT on all API requests
- Role-based access (field_officer, finance, manager)
- Input validation on all key endpoints (e.g., createField, createHarvest)
- Consistent identifiers (farmer ObjectId or numeric external_id) to avoid orphan records

6) Expected Outcomes (Success Metrics)
- Reduce payment processing time from days to hours
- Improve data completeness for fields and harvests (>95%)
- Provide live figures for active farms and workforce
- Increase transparency through searchable reports and consistent IDs

7) Scope Boundaries
- In scope: field data capture, harvest logs, payments, basic reports, dashboards
- Out of scope (current phase): inventory management, advanced forecasting/ML, complex logistics/warehousing

8) Future Roadmap (High-Level)
- Officer attribution on fields and per-officer summaries
- REST summaries for dashboards (e.g., /fields/summary)
- Enhanced farmer onboarding (KYC, mobile contact integration)
- Notifications/alerts (threshold breaches, overdue visits)
- Offline-first capture for areas with poor connectivity
